# Material Allergen Manager

This is a hobby project, a full stack web app to manage the allergen classification and inventory of a made up company's materials. I've created it mainly to practice Domain Driven Design principles on the backend with ASP.NET Core, MediatR, CQRS and vertical slicing. On the frontend, a SvelteKit application is running, using the Skeleton UI toolkit, with TailwindCSS.

## Todo

- [ ] Unit tests (xUnit)
- [ ] Integration testing (Taurus)
- [ ] Exception filter
- [ ] Integrate the cookie-based auth between BE and FE
- [ ] Inventory/stock management module
